"Rochambeau Wars!" was created over 6 weeks as part of the final project of the CSS385 Game Design course at the University of Washington.
The project was entirely open ended, with the professor simply asking for a team to be formed and a game to be delivered before the end of the quarter. Our shared love of "Advance Wars" and the Gameboy Advance era ultimately led to the creation of "Rochambeau Wars!", a multiplayer turn-based strategy homage to the portable games of the early 2000s. The team strongly felt that all parts of the game should be our own, and as such all assets were created in house by the team. I personally served as both the Lead Programmer and the UI Artist, alongside managing the group repository and communication channels. We were not able to accomplish all we originally set out to, with single player and audio notably missing. However, we are overwhelmingly proud of the game we created over those 42 very busy days.
